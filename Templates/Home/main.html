            <p class="text-center fs-5">
               This AI-powered Posture Detection System helps users identify and correct posture deformities using advanced machine learning
                and image processing techniques. By analyzing side-profile images, it detects spinal misalignments, forward head posture, and other issues that 
                can lead to long-term discomfort. Using Python and OpenCV, the system evaluates body posture and recommends personalized exercises tailored to improvement. 
                Poor posture can cause back pain, muscle fatigue, and decreased mobilityâ€”this tool helps prevent such issues. The project combines AI-driven detection and fitness 
                recommendations to promote better posture awareness.
